# Week 4

- The files in order are `Building_your_Deep....ipynb`, followed by `Deep Neural Network - Application.ipynb`
- The former is where the forward and backwards propagation funtions for 2-layer and l-layer networks were defined.
- The latter is merely an application of these concepts to a cat vs non-cat classification problem.
